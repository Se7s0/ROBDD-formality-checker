# **RODBB Equivalence Checker**

## **1. Project Overview**
The **RODBB Equivalence Checker** is a tool designed to construct and compare **Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs)** based on two input Boolean functions. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for determining the equivalence or non-equivalence of Boolean functions through graphical representations.

## **2. Features**
- **Input Boolean Functions**: Users can enter two Boolean functions for comparison.
- **Boolean Function Parser**: Parses the input Boolean functions into a format suitable for processing.
- **ROBDD Constructor**: Constructs the Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams for the given Boolean functions.
- **ROBDD Comparator**: Compares the two ROBDDs to determine if they are equivalent (Proof) or not (Disproof).
- **Graphical Creator**: Visualizes the ROBDDs of both functions and presents formal results regarding their equality or inequality.

## **3. How It Works**
1. **Input**: The user provides two Boolean functions as input.
2. **Parsing**: The Boolean functions are parsed and converted into an internal representation.
3. **ROBDD Construction**: The ROBDDs for both functions are constructed based on the parsed representation.
4. **Comparison**: The ROBDDs are compared to check for equivalence or non-equivalence.
5. **Visualization**: The resulting ROBDDs are displayed graphically, along with the formal results of the comparison.
